# House Price Prediction - My Learning Journey

## About This Project

This is my final year 

## What I Built
* Data Analysis Pipeline: Comprehensive EDA with 15+ visualizations
* Multiple ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost comparison
* Feature Engineering: Created 10+ new features from domain knowledge
* Model Evaluation: Cross-validation and performance metrics
* Clean Code Structure: Modular design following best practices

## My Results

## Quick Start
### Installation

### Try It Out

## What I Learned
### Technical Skills
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling
* Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw data
* Model Selection: Comparing different algorithms systematically
* Cross-Validation: Avoiding overfitting through proper evaluation
* Code Organization: Writing clean, modular Python code
### Key Insights from the Data
* Location matters most: ZIP code explains ~40% of price variance
* Square footage is king: Strong 0.75 correlation with price
* Bathrooms > Bedrooms: More bathrooms add more value than bedrooms
* Age effect: Houses built after 1990 have significant premium

## Challenges I Overcame
* Data Quality: 15% missing values in key features
* Outliers: Luxury homes skewing the model
* Feature Selection: Too many features causing overfiting
* Model Interpretation: Understanding what drives predictions

## Project Structure

## Deep Dive: My Process

## Visualizations & Analysis

## Current Limitations & Futur Work
### What Could Be Better
* More Data:
* Advanced Models: Haven't tried neural networks yet
* Feature Engineering: Could use more domain expertise
* Deployment: Model isn't production-ready

## Resources That Helped Me
* Courses: Andrew Ng's ML Course
* Datasets: Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Data
* Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Feedback Welcome!
As a learning project, I'd love feedback from the community:
* Code review suggestions
* Better modeling approaches
* Feature engineering ideas
* General best parctices
Feel free to open an issue or reach out!
